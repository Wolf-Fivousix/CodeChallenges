// Given a numbers array find out how many moves would take to make all numbers equal.
// You can only change n-1 number at a time. N = numbers.length

// Iterate through the array and increase all but the highest numbers by 1.
// Do so until all numbers are equal.
// Return the number of times you performed the change.
