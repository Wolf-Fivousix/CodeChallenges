Complete the blanks in the following question with the appropriate
answer.

Alice P. Hacker has two types of memory that she’s using to
build her system to store her objects. The first type, type A, is
extremely fast, but it’s expensive and she doesn’t have much of
it. She has 10GB of type A memory that can being used to store
objects, and reading an object from this memory takes 5ms.
The second type of memory, type Z, is a lot slower, but it’s
cheap, and so Alice bought a lot of it. She has 1TB of the second
type of memory that she can use to store objects, and reading an
object from this memory takes 200ms.
Alice decides she’s going to build a system where she keeps all
of her objects in the second type of memory, and then also
keeps copies of some of those objects in the first type so that
she can do some of her reads more quickly. Alice has 2048
objects, all of the same size, which use up all of her second type
of memory storage. Alice decides to analyze different ways to
pick and choose what she keeps in her type A memory, and how
they affect her expected object read performance.


Please round all answers to 3 decimal places. If Alice is naive and decides
to randomly fill her type A memory with objects and never change it,
what is her expected time to read 10 randomly selected objects out of the
2048 (in ms)? __________ ms Alice now runs a workload
where she reads 20 objects per minute. 50% of the objects she reads are
objects she's seen in the past 30 seconds, and the other 50% of the
objects are randomly chosen from the full 2048. Using the same naive
strategy as before, what is her expected average read time for an object
with this workload? ________________ ms Alice tries to improve
her performance. She decides that, every time she reads an object, if it is
not in her type A memory, she will put it there. When she needs to
remove something, she will remove the thing that she read least recently.
What is Alice's average read time per object in the best case scenario?
