// Fun With Anagrams

// Two strings are anagrams if they are permutations of each other.
// In other words, both stirngs have the same size and the same characters.
// For example, "aaagmnrs" is an anagram of "anagrams". Given an array of strings, remove
// each stirng that is an anagram of an earlier string, then retur nthe remaining array in 
// sorted order.

// Example:

// str = [code ,doce, ecod, framer, frame]

// code and doce are anagrams. Remove "doce" from the array and keep the first occurance of "code" in the array.
// code and ecod are anagrams. Do the same as above.
// code an framer are not anagrams. Keep both stirngs in the array.
// framer and frame are not anagrams due to the extra "r" in framer. Keep both strings in the array.

// result is [code, framer, frame]
